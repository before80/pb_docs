# Reference Guides

Reference documentation for working with protocol buffer classes in C++, Java, Python, Go, C#, Objective-C, Ruby, PHP, and Dart, as well as some reference documentation for Protocol Buffers itself.



This section contains reference documentation for working with protocol buffer classes in C++, Java, Python, Go, C#, Objective-C, Ruby, PHP, and Dart, as well as some reference documentation for Protocol Buffers itself. The documentation for each language includes (where available):

- A reference guide to the code generated by the protocol buffer compiler from your `.proto` files.
- Generated API documentation for the provided source code.

Note that there are APIs for several more languages in the pipeline – for details, see [Other Languages]({{< ref "/docs/ReferenceGuides/OtherLanguages" >}}).
